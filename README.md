- Real-time **Water Quality Monitoring** using simulated IoT data
- **Resource Usage Tracking** with leakage detection
- **User Issue Reporting** (e.g., contamination, flooding)
- **Admin Dashboard** for data oversight and action
- Simple **User Interface** with no login required for general use
- Admin-only secure access to sensitive operations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend/Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Development Environment**: XAMPP
